This is an entry for [7DRL 2014][7drl]. It's a survival, story-driven
adventure game, focusing on providing an interesting atmosphere.

## Story

A creeping wall of mysterious corruption is flowing across the land,
killing and wilting everything it touches. Your only hope is to escape
northward!

The corruption will follow you on your heels from the south. Watch
your supplies, rest when you get tired, and do whatever it takes to
survive.
