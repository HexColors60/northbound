# Northbound Roguelike

* Play it online: [Northbound](http://skeeto.github.io/northbound/)
* [UberHunter's playthrough](http://youtu.be/J4jOxma4uhE)

This is an entry for [7DRL 2014][7drl]. It's a survival, story-driven
adventure game, focusing on providing an interesting atmosphere.

## Story

A creeping wall of mysterious corruption is flowing across the land,
killing and wilting everything it touches. Your only hope is to escape
northward!

The corruption will follow you on your heels from the south. Watch
your supplies, rest when you get tired, and do whatever it takes to
survive.

## Running Locally

The game *can* be run locally from this repository, but due to browser
security limitations **it must be hosted through a web server**, not
visited directly on your filesystem. If you happen to have Python
installed, this is simple:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
