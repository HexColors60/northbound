- title: A wanderer asks to join you.
  description: >-
    A weary old man in ragged clothing approaches you slowly. He must
    have been following you for awhile now.

    "My entire village fell to the corruption," he says. "I have
    nothing left except for the clothes on my back. May I travel with
    you for as long as I am able?"
  options:
    - answer: "\"No, I can't have you slowing me down.\""
      result: The man faces the south and sits down, awaiting his death.
    - answer: "\"Yes, but you must keep up.\""
      result: The old man joins your party.

    - answer: Kill the man and take anything valuable.
      result: >-
        You easily kill the man, who puts up no fight. There are a few
        coins on his body.

- title: Old Ralph collapses.
  filter: [[hasPeople, ["Old Ralph"]]]
  description: >-
    You hear the dust stir behind you as Old Ralph collapses from
    exhaustion for the third time. He's struggling to keep pace. The
    corruption will catch up with you soon if you keep on like this.

    "Just leave me here. I'll only slow you down," he says. Though, as
    you consider the circumstances, his eyes speak very different
    words.
  options:
    - answer: Rest here for awhile (-10 supplies, corruption advances 5 tiles).
      result: The rest allowed Old Ralph to recover.
      scripts: [[supplies, -10], [advance, 5], [karma, 10]]
    - answer: Leave Old Ralph behind.
      result: The old man quietly resigns to his fate.
      scripts: [[remove, "Old Ralph"], [karma, -1]]
    - answer: >-
        Put him out of his misery. Better to die here than to the
        horrors of corruption.
      result: >-
        Before Old Ralph realizes what's coming, you quickly run your
        blade across his throat. Though it feels as if an hour has
        passed, less than a minute later he is dead.
