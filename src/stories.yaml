- title: A wanderer asks to join you.
  description: >-
    A weary old man in ragged clothing approaches you slowly. He must
    have been following you for awhile now.

    "My entire village fell to the corruption," he says. "I have
    nothing left except for the clothes on my back. May I travel with
    you for as long as I am able?"
  options:
    - answer: "\"No, I can't have you slowing me down.\""
      result: The man faces the south and sits down, awaiting his death.
    - answer: "\"Yes, but you must keep up.\""
      result: The old man joins your party.

    - answer: Kill the man and take anything valuable.
      result: >-
        You easily kill the man, who puts up no fight. There are a few
        coins on his body.
