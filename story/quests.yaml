    After following some light smoke billowing in the distance, you
    come across an abandoned campsite with a smoldering fire. It must
    have been left behind recently from others heading north. Oddly
    they seemed to have left some supplies by accident.
  options:
    - answer: Take the supplies with you.
      result: You add the supplies to your pack.
      scripts: [[supplies, 20], [setState, campsite, 1]]
    - answer: This is too suspicious.
      result: You move on.

- title: Look what washed up
  placement: {types: [WATER1], distance: 1d10+20}
  description: >-
    You come across a message in a bottle washed up on the shore of a
    lake, the bottle bobbing gently in the waves. Written on the
    parchment inside is very deliberate, careful calligraphy saying:

    <pre>
    Corruption of the land<br/>
    A result of corruption of the mind<br/>
    Together we all must band<br/>
    And work together in kind<br/>
    </pre>

  options:
    - answer: Throw the bottle back into the lake.
      result: The bottle disappears in mid air without landing in the lake!
    - answer: Take the message with you.
      result: You discard the bottle and tuck the note into your pocket.
