    After following some light smoke billowing in the distance, you
    come across an abandoned campsite with a smoldering fire. It must

    they seemed to have left some supplies by accident.
  options:
    - answer: Take the supplies with you.
      result: You add the supplies to your pack.
      scripts: [[supplies, 20]]
    - answer: This is too suspicious.
      result: You move on.
