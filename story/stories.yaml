  description: >-
    You freeze, sensing activity in your pack.
    {{#minParty 1}}
    Your {{pluralize game.player.party.length "companion" "companions"}}
    watch you expectantly.
    {{/minParty}}

    You open your bag and your hands practically leap to the
    totem... or was it the totem that lept? At the moment of contact
    your surroundings disappear and you are surrounded by pure
    nothingness. Your body and all of its senses have vanished.

    Yet this is not isolation. You are aware, even more aware of your
    surroundings.
    {{#minParty 1}}
    You know your
    {{pluralize game.player.party.length "companion is" "companions are"}}
    nearby.
    {{/minParty}}

    {{#hasPeople "Kelsey"}}
    A powerful sense of loss washes past you as you mind's gaze passes
    over Kelsey.
    {{/hasPeople}}

    {{#hasPeople "Old Ralph"}}
    As your focus rests on Old Ralph you experience a richness of
    hope, joy, and expectation.
    {{/hasPeople}}

    You feel welcomed in this place. You sense that the welcome is
    directed not to you but through you and to the Tior. The Tior is
    welcome and you have its blessing.

    The satisfaction and belonging you feel are as real and powerful
    as the most powerful of your previous experiences. And yet, as if
    on the horizon, you can feel the boiling lust of the corruption.

    The vision fades and you again experience the world through the
    senses of your body.
